#### Discount Calculator (Personal Project)

I developed a discount calculator as a personal project, providing users with the ability to calculate the final price of a discounted product. Here are some highlights:

- **Description:** Created a simple web form to input the original price and discount percentage.
- **Technologies Used:** HTML for page structure and JavaScript for calculation logic.
- **Notable Features:**
  - Intuitive user interface using HTML tags.
  - Implementation of calculation logic in JavaScript to determine the final discounted price.
  - Integration of external files, such as "main.js," to enhance code modularity.
  - Inclusion of a link to another web page ("Form Activity with Coupons") to provide a more comprehensive user experience.

This project showcases my ability to develop interactive and functional solutions using standard web technologies!
